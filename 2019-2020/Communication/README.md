# Instructions
- To be able to communicate with your raspi, you need to run "server.py" on the main computer.
- Also client code must be running at this time, called as "client.py", on the raspberry pi.
  - Be sure that ip adress on both files are identical and match with the main computer's static ip.

```python
HOST = '127.0.0.1'
PORT = 3535
```

You can find the files we used to test the gamepad and configure the camera in the Debug folder.
