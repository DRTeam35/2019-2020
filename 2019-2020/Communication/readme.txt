to be able to communicate with your raspi, you need to run "server.py"

also client code must be running at this time, called as "client.py"

be careful about the IP addresses & Host
if you don't know how to communicate, check "iletisim.txt"

You can find the files we used to test the gamepad and configure the camera in the Debug folder.
